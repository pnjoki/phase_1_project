Author: Paul Gitonga Njoki
Client: With all major corporations developing original visual studios. Microsoft wants to join in and has chosen to open a new movie studio, but they don't know anything about virtual video creation. Microsoft has tasked me with determining what steps they want to take in order to enter this field. I was given many data files to evaluate and make recommendations to the head of Microsoft's new movie studio based on my findings in order to succeed in the field of movie development.. METHOD: CRISP DM I will be following the CRISP DM process for this task The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model that serves as the base for a data science process. It has six sequential phases;

    Business understanding – To venture into movie production.
      Data understanding - Data was obtained from top movie wesites of which it was already provided.
      Data preparation – cleaning data,removing unwanted columns, removing outliers changing to prefered data types.
      Modeling – visualization with matplotlib.
      Evaluation.
      Deployment.
      Data and Analysis Overview In this analysis, I will perform an analysis on large data sets containing different types of movies. The data includes many different types of information about each movie, ranging from the release date, the director, the studio, average rating, rating, gross domestic and foreign and many other information obtained from different movie sites, we see this when reading the separate data files. I utilized three different data sources for my analysis in order to have the most comprehensive view of the current movie performance.
• Rotten Tomatoes Data: The data obtained was in a tsv format with 1560 rows and 12 columns. From the data we see that the most produced genre from value counts is Drama followed by comedy.
• The Box Office Mojo Data: which was provided as a zipped data in csv format, containing 5 columns and 3387 movies in total. The data set was obtained from the Box Office website which ranges from 2010-2018. From the mojo data we see that most movies were filmed in IFC studio.
I did my analysis by performing some descriptive analysis on each data set. Through this I will be able to obtain trends in the data pertaining to what needs to be known for a movie to be successful. This analysis will mainly be done through examination of graphs of particular attributes.
